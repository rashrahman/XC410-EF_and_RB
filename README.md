# XC410 - Excessive Force and Racial Bias Project

In our project for XC 410: DS4G, we analyzed several incidents for the BPD. In specific, we looked at occurrences of excessive force (EF), and racial bias (RB) cases. Using an automation technique, we came up with results that detected EF and RB cases (in years 2016 and 2019) that were not categorized correctly by the BPD.
